	Camila Cabello auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. She auditioned with Aretha Franklin's "Respect", however, her audition was not aired because the TV show did not get the rights for the song. After elimination during the "bootcamp" portion of the process in Miami, Florida, Cabello was called back to the stage along with Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei, Lauren Jauregui, and Dinah Jane to form the girl group that would later become known as Fifth Harmony. After finishing in third place on the show they signed a joint deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell, and Epic Records, L.A. Reid's record label.
<br>On December 18, 2016, the group announced Cabello's departure, with both parts explaining different circumstances of the exit. She appeared in a previously taped performance with the group on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. Writing about Cabello's time on the group, a Billboard journalist noted it is "rather uncommon for someone to stand out in a collective as much as Cabello has over the past years," also mentioning how her activity on social media and close interaction with her audience helped her potential as a breakout act.
<br>New writing and recording sessions for her album were influenced by the success of her single "Havana", which postponed its original release date. The single has reached number 1 in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as number 2 in the United States. Titled Camila, her debut album will be released on January 12, 2018.

	All-Russian fame came to Elgeya in 2017, when the song "Pink Wine", recorded together with Feduk , became one of the main Russian-language hits of the year [6] . The clip for the song was released on November 14, 2017 and caused a conflict between the performers who did not understand the names in the video's title: the video was originally published by Feduk and his name was the first in the list of performers. Two days after the publication, the video on Youtube was blocked, typing up to this point two million views. A day later the video was unlocked, but now the first in the list of performers was Aljey [7] . Later, Eljey stated that the reason for the blockage was not the order of the names of the performers, but the claims for color correction in the video clip [8] . At the height of the conflictblogger Eldar Jarakhov sharply criticized the management of Elgeya on Twitter , and Ilya Prusikin , the frontman of Little Big, said that Aljey gave out a song in which he originally participated as a guest performer for his [7] .
